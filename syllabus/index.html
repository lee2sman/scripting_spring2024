<h1 id="course-description">Course Description</h1>
<p>Scripting For The Web is an upper level programming course designed
to cohesively work with the web as technology, primarily through
Javascript and its dynamic libraries and frameworks. We will build
websites and web applications for clients and servers that use live data
and interactivity as input, giving this work shape and form through
code.</p>
<p>This course is designed to be flexible to student learning goals and
interests. The Web is an evolving platform and technology. We will be
covering a large array of programming interfaces, languages, frameworks
and applications including HTML, CSS, Javascript, the DOM, NodeJS,
Express, APIs, markdown, Bash, Linux, Git. Our goal will be to treat the
web as a space for exploration and as a platform we can shape and on
which to build projects that we envision.</p>
<p>Some of our learning will be difficult. Students will need to
consistently write code and build websites and web applications multiple
days a week throughout the semester in order to reinforce their learning
and to complete their projects. In addition to our assignments, students
are expected to do research out of class, to spend time debugging and
solving coding errors and challenges, and to be bold and take charge of
their learning.</p>
<p>This class is in Math and Computer Science, cross-listed with New
Media, and we will take an expansive view of the web as medium to
manipulate through scripting. In addition to our technical work we will
discuss topics relating to our use of this technology such as privacy,
user experience, accessible design, open source culture, and abuses of
social media.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>a working knowledge of the underlying technology of the web and how
to build websites and web applications on this platform</li>

<li>ability to demonstrate knowledge and application of a number of
programming languages and contexts: Javascript, Node.js, the DOM, Linux
systems, Version Control</li>
<li>ability to create and deploy a node-based web application with
interaction, data persistence and data/API queries</li>

<h3 id="academic-integrity-policy">Academic Integrity Policy</h3>
<p>The Purchase College academic integrity policy explicitly forbids
cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of academic dishonesty. Plagiarism
is the appropriation or imitation of the language, ideas, and/or
thoughts of another person and the representation of them as one’s own
original work. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves
with the definition of plagiarism and the acceptable methods of
attribution. Violation of any of the above may lead to formal
disciplinary action and the following sanctions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum Sanction: Failing grade on the assignment or examination.
Maximum Sanction: Expulsion</li>
<li>Recommended Sanction (First Offense): Failing grade for the
course</li>
<li>Recommended Sanction (Second Offense): Expulsion</li>
</ul>
<p>Students who have any questions or doubts about whether any activity
is academically permissible should check with the instructor.</p>
<h3 id="accessibility-statement">Accessibility Statement</h3>
<p>The Office of Disability Resources collaborates directly with
students who identify documented disabilities to create accommodation
plans, including testing accommodations, in order for students to access
course content and validly demonstrate learning. For those students who
may require accommodations, please contact the Office of Disability
Resources as soon as possible, 914-251-6035, ODR@purchase.edu (Student

<h3 id="mental-health-and-well-being">Mental Health and Well-being</h3>
<p>University faculty and staff recognize that mental health and stress
can impact college performance and interfere with daily life activities.
At Purchase, Counseling &amp; Behavioral Health Services can provide
support if you’re struggling with feeling overwhelmed, anxious,
depressed, lost, stuck or in a crisis. Please call (914)251-6390 or
visit the <a
href="https://www.purchase.edu/counseling-center/">Counseling Center
website</a>  for more information. CBHS services are free and

<p>We support all students experiencing emergencies. Services include
therapy, support groups, stress reduction at the Harbor Center, and
other activities.  The Counseling Center in Humanities Lower Level is
open M-F, from 9:00a.m.– 5:00p.m. for appointments and walk-up
scheduling, or call (914) 251-6390.  The Harbor Center Sanctuary in Fort
Awesome is available for stress reduction, mindfulness and meditation
training, free drop-in classes and support groups, and relaxation.</p>
<h3 id="student-contact">Student Contact</h3>
<p>All students are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with
Purchase College’s Student Code of Conduct.  Any repetitive or
disruptive behavior, including but not limited to outbursts,
intoxication/drug use, personal or physical threats, damage to property,
etc., may result in the professor requesting the student to leave class,
contacting University Police, and/or notifying the Office of Community
Standards.</p>
<h3 id="learning-center-tutoring-support">Learning Center (Tutoring
Support)</h3>
<p>All students at Purchase College can take advantage of our tutoring
services in the Learning Center and the Einstein Corner. These are free,
45-minute, peer-to-peer tutoring sessions in a variety of subjects and
in writing across the disciplines. Sessions can happen in person or
through the Online Writing Lab up to 3x/week. The OWL allows students to
submit a paper draft and get written feedback by email within 48
business hours. We strongly recommend face-to-face meetings for
first-year students and multilingual writers. I encourage you to take
advantage of this service to help you excel in this class, as well as
your other courses. Please visit the Learning Center and Einstein Corner
websites for more information.</p>
<h3 id="classroom-expectations">Classroom expectations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please be on time, listen actively, and participate in class
discussion and activities.</li>
<li>Please put cell phones in ‘sleep’ mode at the start of class. If you
need such devices for personal obligations, please take a break and
leave the classroom.</li>
<li>Laptops may be used in class for note taking and coding only. During
class, don’t check social media, do homework for other classes, buy
things, etc. Stay engaged in the class!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-requirements">Course Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Attendance and punctuality are expected for every class.<br />
</li>
<li>Attendance will be taken at every class.<br />
</li>
<li>Your presence is vital for participation in varied learning
activities and small-group work.<br />
</li>
<li>You are allowed 1 unexcused absences.<br />
</li>
<li>Additional unexcused absences may affect your grade.<br />
</li>
<li>Late arrivals or early departures may be counted as absences.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>If you are sick, don’t come to class. Get in touch with the
professor.</strong></li>
<li>If you miss class, it is your responsibility to find out from
classmates what you missed and submit assignments on time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning programming is a cumulative effort. Each class builds on
what you have learned in previous classes. Missing class can
substantially set you back in this process. Therefore, it is important
that you attend every class.</p>
<p>Coding can be difficult, and struggling with the material is part of
the learning process. Students are allowed to collaborate to learn from
each other. Do not collaborate in order to simply find out a solution to
a project. Each participant should contribute approximately equally, and
what you turn in should be your own. Copying a solution from another
student, even if you change a few minor things such as variable names,
is not a collaboration. You may help someone learn something, but you
can not tell them what to code. If you have questions about
collaboration or academic integrity, get in touch with me via email,
talk with me before or after class, or come to office hours.</p>
