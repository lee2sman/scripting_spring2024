# Course Description

Scripting For The Web is an upper level programming course designed to cohesively work with the web as technology, primarily through Javascript and its dynamic libraries and frameworks. We will build websites and web applications for clients and servers that use live data and interactivity as input, giving this work shape and form through code.

This course is designed to be flexible to student learning goals and interests. The Web is an evolving platform and technology. We will be covering a large array of programming interfaces, languages, frameworks and applications including HTML, CSS, Javascript, the DOM, NodeJS, Express, APIs, markdown, Bash, Linux, Git. Our goal will be to treat the web as a space for exploration and as a platform we can shape and on which to build projects that we envision.

Some of our learning will be difficult. Students will need to consistently write code and build websites and web applications multiple days a week throughout the semester in order to reinforce their learning and to complete their projects. In addition to our assignments, students are expected to do research out of class, to spend time debugging and solving coding errors and challenges, and to be bold and take charge of their learning.

This class is in Math and Computer Science, cross-listed with New Media, and we will take an expansive view of the web as medium to manipulate through scripting. In addition to our technical work we will discuss topics relating to our use of this technology such as privacy, user experience, accessible design, open source culture, and abuses of social media.

## Learning Objectives

* a working knowledge of the underlying technology of the web and how to build websites and web applications on this platform
* knowledge of basic software design patterns for software for the web, including asynchronous versus synchronous programming, hosting, client versus server, and responsive design
* ability to demonstrate knowledge and application of a number of programming languages and contexts: Javascript, Node.js, the DOM, Linux systems, Version Control
* ability to create and deploy a node-based web application with interaction, data persistence
and data/API queries

## Required Texts and Tools

* A computer to regularly work on set up and organized! We will be making so many websites in this class. You must have a good file structure and it is imperative that you back up your work!
* A Web Browser. Firefox, Chromium, Brave are recommended.  
* A Text editor or IDE. This semester I am going to teach with Visual Studio code, but other editors are acceptable as well.
* A notebook. Please bring a notebook and pen or pencil to every class. Use it to jot down notes, respond to prompts, and for in-class sketching.
* A virtual home (a website, if you will) that will link to all of the work you create for this class.


### Academic Integrity Policy

The Purchase College academic integrity policy explicitly forbids cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of academic dishonesty. Plagiarism is the appropriation or imitation of the language, ideas, and/or thoughts of another person and the representation of them as one’s own original work. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the definition of plagiarism and the acceptable methods of attribution. Violation of any of the above may lead to formal disciplinary action and the following sanctions:

* Minimum Sanction: Failing grade on the assignment or examination. Maximum Sanction: Expulsion
* Recommended Sanction (First Offense): Failing grade for the course
* Recommended Sanction (Second Offense): Expulsion

Students who have any questions or doubts about whether any activity is academically permissible should check with the instructor.

### Accessibility Statement

The Office of Disability Resources collaborates directly with students who identify documented disabilities to create accommodation plans, including testing accommodations, in order for students to access course content and validly demonstrate learning. For those students who may require accommodations, please contact the Office of Disability Resources as soon as possible, 914-251-6035, ODR@purchase.edu (Student Services Building, #316A), https://www.purchase.edu/odr.

### Mental Health and Well-being

University faculty and staff recognize that mental health and stress can impact college performance and interfere with daily life activities. At Purchase, Counseling & Behavioral Health Services can provide support if you’re struggling with feeling overwhelmed, anxious, depressed, lost, stuck or in a crisis. Please call (914)251-6390 or visit the [Counseling Center website](https://www.purchase.edu/counseling-center/)  for more information. CBHS services are free and confidential. 

We support all students experiencing emergencies. Services include therapy, support groups, stress reduction at the Harbor Center, and other activities.  The Counseling Center in Humanities Lower Level is open M-F, from 9:00a.m.– 5:00p.m. for appointments and walk-up scheduling, or call (914) 251-6390.  The Harbor Center Sanctuary in Fort Awesome is available for stress reduction, mindfulness and meditation training, free drop-in classes and support groups, and relaxation.

### Student Contact

All students are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with Purchase College’s Student Code of Conduct.  Any repetitive or disruptive behavior, including but not limited to outbursts, intoxication/drug use, personal or physical threats, damage to property, etc., may result in the professor requesting the student to leave class, contacting University Police, and/or notifying the Office of Community Standards.

### Learning Center (Tutoring Support)

All students at Purchase College can take advantage of our tutoring services in the Learning Center and the Einstein Corner. These are free, 45-minute, peer-to-peer tutoring sessions in a variety of subjects and in writing across the disciplines. Sessions can happen in person or through the Online Writing Lab up to 3x/week. The OWL allows students to submit a paper draft and get written feedback by email within 48 business hours. We strongly recommend face-to-face meetings for first-year students and multilingual writers. I encourage you to take advantage of this service to help you excel in this class, as well as your other courses. Please visit the Learning Center and Einstein Corner websites for more information.

### Classroom expectations

* Please be on time, listen actively, and participate in class discussion and activities. 
* Please put cell phones in 'sleep' mode at the start of class. If you need such devices for personal obligations, please take a break and leave the classroom.
* Laptops may be used in class for note taking and coding only. During class, don't check social media, do homework for other classes, buy things, etc. Stay engaged in the class!

## Course Requirements

* Attendance and punctuality are expected for every class.  
* Attendance will be taken at every class.  
* Your presence is vital for participation in varied learning activities and small-group work.  
* You are allowed 1 unexcused absences.  
* Additional unexcused absences may affect your grade.  
* Late arrivals or early departures may be counted as absences.  
* **If you are sick, don't come to class. Get in touch with the professor.**
* If you miss class, it is your responsibility to find out from classmates what you missed and submit assignments on time.

Learning programming is a cumulative effort. Each class builds on what you have learned in previous classes. Missing class can substantially set you back in this process. Therefore, it is important that you attend every class. 

Coding can be difficult, and struggling with the material is part of the learning process. Students are allowed to collaborate to learn from each other. Do not collaborate in order to simply find out a solution to a project. Each participant should contribute approximately equally, and what you turn in should be your own. Copying a solution from another student, even if you change a few minor things such as variable names, is not a collaboration. You may help someone learn something, but you can not tell them what to code. If you have questions about collaboration or academic integrity, get in touch with me via email, talk with me before or after class, or come to office hours.
